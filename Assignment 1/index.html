        <h2>1. Flatness</h2>

        <p>The people living in the cave saw nothing their whole lives except the eye of the god that they worship. This unblinking eye gave the people comfort as they thought that it meant their god was always watching over them. The god’s eye never moved for the entire time they lived in that cave, until one day<span class="clickable" id="first-change"> the eye started to look around the room.</span> The people in the cave were confused and did not know why the god suddenly started looking around at them. After some time, the people living in the cave started to get used to their god watching over them. However, eventually after looking around at the people in the cave for a few a while, <span class="clickable" id="second-change">the god that had been watching them closed its eye </span>as quickly and suddenly as it had started moving. The people in the cave felt their hearts pound against their chests in fearful anticipation as the god that was watching over them had never closed its eye before. Ever since this day, the people living in the cave may never be able to live comfortably again with the knowledge that they are no longer being watched over by their loving god.</p>

        <p>Nick Sousanis’ concept of flatness is how there is a place called “Flatland” where people living inside of it cannot perceive anything more than what they can immediately see in front of them. In the flatland, everything has a place and every action was already determined before any person who lives there even thinks about making it. The world view of the people living in the cave fits this definition of flat because the shadows being reflected onto the wall of the cave is the only thing that they can perceive and because of this it makes them believe the shadows are the real thing of what they look like they could be. In this example, the people think that the shadows of a ring and a circle on the wall are the eye and pupil of a god. When the shadow of the circle starts moving back and forth inside the ring, the people in the cave just saw what they believed was the eye of their god looking around the cave because they have no perception of the fact that it could be a three dimensional object somewhere else casting a shadow onto the wall they are looking at.</p>

        <h2>2. Seeing Double</h2>

        <p>Looking at the cave from the outside where the people living in the cave could never see, we are able to see the objects that cast the shadows onto the wall of the cave that the people inside have been watching their whole lives. These people who have been living outside the cave have been tasked with creating the shadows for the people inside have a fire burning all day every day in order to constantly have shadows cast onto the wall for the people inside to look at. One day while the people who live outside the cave are holding the objects casting the shadows,<span class="clickable" id="third-change"> one of them drops the objects he was holding </span>unaware of the consequences of what they just did. Since these objects were the things that casted the shadows into the cave for those inside to look at, dropping these objects makes those shadows that they were looking at suddenly disappear off of the bottom of the wall for what seemed to be no reason since they could never understand the reality of what the shadows they have been looking at really are.</p>

        <p>Another concept that we explored in class that was presented by Nick Sousanis is the concept of seeing double. Seeing double is a way to look at something by understanding how something can be seen differently by looking at it through a different light. The best example of this is the test of looking at an object in the distance while closing one eye, then closing that one and opening the other eye to see how it seems to change position. This concept of seeing double can be seen in more ways than just physically seeing something in different places from different perspectives. Another example of seeing double can be seen in this version of Plato’s allegory of the cave. This shows the concept of seeing double because the people outside of the cave can only see the three dimensional objects they are holding that are casting shadows on the wall and the fire behind them that is casting the light that is creating the shadows, and the people inside the cave can only see the two dimensional shapes on the wall that they think are real. This shows how combining the two views from inside and outside the cave is the only way to see the whole picture of what is truly happening.</p>
